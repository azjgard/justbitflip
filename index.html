    <h2>Example Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines:</strong> Bit Flip could
        be used in a CI pipeline to track the status of various stages in the
        pipeline. For example, you could use Bit Flip to set a "migration
        complete" flag after running database migrations, or to track whether a
        particular test has passed or failed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Application configuration:</strong> Bit Flip could be used to
        store and manage application configuration settings. For example, you
        could use Bit Flip to store settings such as whether a feature is
        enabled or disabled, or whether a particular service is running or not.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Workflow tracking:</strong> Bit Flip could be used to track the
        progress of a workflow or process. For example, you could use Bit Flip
        to track the status of a customer support ticket, or to track the
        progress of a project through different stages of development.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>IoT applications:</strong> Bit Flip could be used in IoT
        applications to store and manage the state of various sensors and
        devices. For example, you could use Bit Flip to store the current
        temperature in a thermostat, or to track whether a door is open or
        closed.
      </li>

    I want to see which PRs are included in this release, so I set a key for
    each one as it merges like {pr-name}-{release-name}. I use a built-in search
    feature to get a list of matching bits when it's time.
